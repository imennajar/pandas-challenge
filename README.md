# How to use Pandas to read information from a CSV file, manipulate it, and return DataFrames for better analysis: :cd:

In this project we will analyze a city's future school budgets and priorities. Thus we will start by analyzing the district-wide standardized test results, and then we will aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance using available information on the school.

# What we will learn from this project:

    - How to create dataframes from an existing dataset or from other dataframes
    
    - How to perform the necessary calculations and create a high-level snapshot of the key metrics
    
    - How to filter, merge, sort, group and bin to enable more vigorous dataset customization
    
    - How to analyze the output Data to make the right decisions
    
# Instructions:
 1. District Summary: Performing the necessary calculations and creating a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:
    
        - Total number of schools

        - Total students

        - Total budget

        - Average test scores (Math and Reading)

        - Passing rates (Math, Reading and both)

     All this information will be used for a subsequent deeper analysis
    
3. School Summary: Performing the necessary calculations and summarizing key metrics about each school:
        
        - Total student count per school

        - Total school budget and per capita spending per school

        - Average test scores per school (Math and Reading)

        - Passing rates (Math, Reading and both)

        - Associate all this information with the name and the type of each school
   
5. Sorting the information to organize and analyze data in a more efficient and meaningful way:

       - Sort the schools by the percentage of Overall Passing to analyze the Highest-Performing Schools and the Lowest-Performing Schools 

6. Placing values into groups to enable more vigorous dataset customization:

        - Scores by Grade: for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school
   
        - Scores by School Spending: average spending ranges (per student)
   
        - Scores by School Size:  school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)
   
        - Scores by School Type: school performance based on the type of the school
            
8. Analyzing and make conclusions for batter decisions

#  Program:

### Tools: 

- Pandas, which is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis
   
- Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computing pltaform, allows the user to compile all aspects of a data project.

### Python script using Pandas:
#### Example with grouping by a criteria
```
#Calculate the total student count per school
per_school_counts =pd.DataFrame({'Total Students':school_data_complete.groupby(['school_name'])['Student ID'].count()})
per_school_counts
```
![groupby](/groupby.png)

#### Example with filtring:
```
#Calculate the number of students per school with reading scores of 70 or higher
students_passing_reading = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["reading_score"] >= 70)]
school_students_passing_reading =pd.DataFrame ({'reading scores of 70 or higher':students_passing_reading.groupby('school_name')['reading_score'].size()})        school_students_passing_reading
```
![filtring](/filter.png)

#### Example with Sorting:
 ```
#Sort the schools by `% Overall Passing` in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
bottom_schools = per_school_summary.sort_values('% Overall Passing',ascending=True)
top_schools["Total students"] = top_schools["Total Students"].map("${:,.0f}".format)
bottom_schools.head(5) 
```

#### Example with benning:
```
#Establish the bins 
spending_bins = [0, 585, 630, 645, 680]
la = ["<$585", "$585-630", "$630-645", "$645-680"]

#Create a copy of the school summary  
school_spending_df = per_school_summary.copy()

#Categorize spending based on the bins
school_spending_df['Per Student Budget']=school_budget_capita['per school capita']
school_spending_df["Spending Ranges (Per Student)"] = pd.cut(school_spending_df['Per Student Budget'],
                                                     spending_bins, labels=la,include_lowest = True)
school_spending_df
```

# Tip:ðŸª„

Take advantage of the perivious seen module, export utile dataframes to excel sheets and insert charts to make the analysis easier. 
Here example of code to export dataframes to excel sheets

```
with pd.ExcelWriter('panda.xlsx')as writer:
    type_summary.to_excel(writer,sheet_name='Sheet_1')
```
