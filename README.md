This analysis is for a city's school district to help the responsibles to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. That is why we will start by analyzing the district-wide standardized test results, then we will aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance With the access to a various information on the school

   1. District Summary: Performing the necessary calculations and creating a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:
    
        - Total number of unique schools

        - Total students

        - Total budget

        - Average test scores (Math and Reading)

        - Passing rates (Math, Reading and both)

     All these information will be used for a later deeper analysis   

   2. School Summary: Performing the necessary calculations and summarizing key metrics about each school:
        
        - Total student count per school

        - Total school budget and per capita spending per school

        - Average test scores per school (Math and Reading)

        - Passing rates (Math, Reading and both)

        - Associate all this information with the name and the type of each school    
        
   3. Sorting the information to organize and analyse Data in more efficient and meaningful way:

       - Sort the schools by the purcentage of Overall Passing to analyse the Highest-Performing Schools and the Lowest-Performing Schools 

   4. Placing values into groups to enable more vigorous dataset customization:

        - Scores by Grade: for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school
        - Scores by School Spending: average spending ranges (per student)
        - Scores by School Size:  school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large)
        - Scores by School Type: school performance based on the type of the school

## Conclusions:

   ### District VS Charter
  
   
   - District schools are large schools without exception,they contien more than 2000 students.

   - Charter schools (except Wilson High School) are small and medium schools, contien  between less than 1000 and 2000 students.

   - District schools get higher budget

   - Charter schools get lower budget

--> The ratio Per Student Budget is not proportional

   - The purcentage of Overall passing for charter schools is obviously higher than district schools

   - The five first highest performing schools are charter schools
    
   - The five last bottom performing schools are district schools

#### Conclusions: The responsibles get involved more on less profitable schools



### Math VS Reading

   - The avarege per school Reading is higher than the avarege per school Math
    
   - The number of students per school with reading scores more than 70 is heigher than the number of students per school with Math scores more than 70 is heigher
    
   - The average of Reading Scores by Grade is much better than the average of Math Scores by Grades (for almost all grades)
    
   - The spending Reading scores is higher than spending Math Scores and consequently spending passing Reading is higher than spending passing Math
    
#### Conclusions: The responsibles get involved more on Reading than Math which negatively impacts on improving Math
